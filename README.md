# XOR problem in neural network
The XOR, or "exclusive OR", problem is a classic problem in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. It is a problem that cannot be solved by a single layer perceptron, and therefore requires a multi-layer perceptron or a deep learning model.

## The XOR function
The XOR function is a binary function that takes two binary inputs and returns a binary output. The output is true if the number of true inputs is odd, and false otherwise. In other words, it returns true if exactly one of the inputs is true, and false otherwise.

The following table shows the truth table for the XOR function:

| Input A | Input B | Output (A XOR B) |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |	
| 1 | 0 | 1 |	
| 1 | 1 | 0 |
